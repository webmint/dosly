# /plan — Technical Implementation Plan

Takes an approved spec and produces a technical plan: research findings, data model, API contracts, and architecture decisions. This is the bridge between WHAT (spec) and HOW (task breakdown).

## Usage
```
/plan [spec-file-or-feature-dir]
```

## Arguments
- `$ARGUMENTS` — Path to a spec file or feature directory in `specs/`. If empty, use the most recently modified feature.

## Context in the Workflow

```
/research (optional) → /specify → /plan → /breakdown → /execute-task → /review → /verify → /summarize → /finalize
```

`/plan` runs AFTER the spec is approved, BEFORE task breakdown. It answers technical questions the spec intentionally left open (specs describe WHAT, plans describe HOW).

## Prerequisites

1. A spec must exist with **Status: Approved**
2. If status is still "Draft", stop and inform the user

## PHASE 0: Research Evaluation

**Guard**: Read `constitution.md`. If it contains `_Run /constitute to populate_`, stop: "⛔ constitution.md has not been populated yet. Run `/constitute` before using `/plan`."

**This phase always runs.** Scan the spec to determine the research depth needed.

**Source Root**: If `CLAUDE.md` specifies a Source Root other than `.`, resolve all source file references relative to that path.

### Step 1: Codebase Research (always)

- Read relevant source files to understand current patterns
- Check how similar features are implemented
- Identify reusable code and patterns
- For greenfield projects: check the constitution's scaffolding guide for pattern references
- The spec already incorporates relevant documentation context from `docs/`. Do not re-read docs — use the spec's "Current State" and "Affected Areas" sections as your primary source

### Step 2: Signal Scan

Read the spec and check for these signals. **Only flag signals for things NOT already in the project's current stack.** If the spec references a library/technology that's already in the project's dependencies (check `CLAUDE.md`, `package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `requirements.txt`, etc.), that is NOT a signal — the team has already made that choice.

| Signal | Example | NOT a signal when... |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| External library/package **not in project dependencies** | "use Stripe SDK" (and Stripe is not in package.json) | Library is already installed |
| New integration with **unconfigured** third-party service | "connect to payment gateway" (no payment config exists) | Service is already integrated |
| Architectural decision where multiple valid approaches exist | "real-time updates" (polling vs SSE vs WebSocket) | Always a signal — requires decision |
| Greenfield pattern not yet present in the codebase | first use of caching, first background job | Pattern already exists in codebase |
| Performance constraints that need benchmarking | "handle 10k concurrent users", "< 200ms response" | Always a signal — requires research |
| Technology **not part of the project's current stack** | new protocol or tool the codebase hasn't used | Technology is already in the stack |

**No signals found** → proceed to Phase 1 with codebase research only.

**1+ signals found** → continue to Step 3.

### Step 3: Deep Research (when signals detected)

For each signal, choose the appropriate research tool:

**For specific libraries named in the spec:**
- Try Context7 first (`resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`) to get current documentation and API details
- If Context7 has no docs for the library, fall back to WebSearch

**For comparing alternatives or architectural decisions:**
- Use WebSearch to find current best practices and proven approaches
- Compare at least 2-3 alternatives with pros/cons
- Check library options: maintenance status, bundle size, community adoption

**For all signals:**
- Look at real-world examples of similar implementations
- Verify external API contracts and limitations

### Research output:

Save to `specs/[feature-name]/research.md`:

```markdown
# Research: [Feature Name]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Signals detected**: [list which signals triggered deep research]

## Questions Investigated
1. [Question] → [Finding + decision]
2. [Question] → [Finding + decision]

## Alternatives Compared

### [Decision Area] (e.g., "Payment processor", "WebSocket library")
| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| [option A] | [pros] | [cons] | Chosen / Rejected |
| [option B] | [pros] | [cons] | Chosen / Rejected |
| [option C] | [pros] | [cons] | Chosen / Rejected |

**Decision**: [chosen option] — [one-line rationale]

## References
- [links to docs, examples, or source files consulted]
```

If no deep research was needed (no signals), skip the research.md file.

## PHASE 1: Technical Design

### 1.1: Data Model (if applicable)

If the feature involves data entities, define them. Save to `specs/[feature-name]/data-model.md`:

```markdown
# Data Model: [Feature Name]

## Entities

### [EntityName]
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | string | yes | Unique identifier |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Relationships
- [Entity A] → [Entity B]: [relationship type and description]

### Validation Rules
- [Field]: [constraint]
```

For existing codebases, reference existing types/interfaces instead of redefining them. Only document NEW or CHANGED entities.

### 1.2: API Contracts (if applicable)

If the feature involves API calls (REST, GraphQL, etc.), define contracts. Save to `specs/[feature-name]/contracts.md`:

```markdown
# API Contracts: [Feature Name]

## [Endpoint/Query/Mutation Name]
- **Type**: [GET/POST/Query/Mutation]
- **Input**: [type definition or reference to existing type]
- **Output**: [type definition or reference to existing type]
- **Errors**: [error cases and response format]
```

For existing codebases, reference existing GraphQL queries/mutations or REST endpoints. Only document NEW or CHANGED contracts.

### 1.3: Architecture Decisions

Document HOW the feature maps to the project's architecture. This is the core of the plan.

## PHASE 2: Write the Plan

Save to `specs/[feature-name]/plan.md`:

```markdown
# Plan: [Feature Name]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Spec**: [path to spec.md]
**Status**: Draft

## Summary

[2-3 sentences: what this plan implements and the technical approach]

## Technical Context

**Architecture**: [from constitution — which layers are involved]
**Error Handling**: [pattern to use]
**State Management**: [approach for this feature]

## Constitution Compliance

[Verify the planned approach doesn't violate any NON-NEGOTIABLE rules]
- Rule X: [compliant / requires attention]
- Rule Y: [compliant / requires attention]

## Implementation Approach

### Layer Map

[Which architectural layers this feature touches and what happens in each]

| Layer | What | Files (existing or new) |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| Domain | [types, interfaces, use cases] | [file paths] |
| Data | [repositories, API calls] | [file paths] |
| Presentation | [components, views, state] | [file paths] |

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Chosen Approach | Why | Alternatives Rejected |
|----------|----------------|-----|----------------------|
| [decision] | [approach] | [rationale] | [alternatives] |

### File Impact

| File | Action | What Changes |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [path] | Create/Modify | [brief description] |
| [path] | Create/Modify | [brief description] |

### Documentation Impact

| Doc File | Action | What Changes |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| docs/features/[name].md | Update/Create | [what needs documenting] |
| docs/api/[name].md | Update | [new endpoints or changed contracts] |
| docs/architecture.md | Update | [if architecture patterns change] |

[If no documentation impact: "No documentation changes expected — internal implementation only."]

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| [risk] | Low/Med/High | Low/Med/High | [how to handle] |

## Dependencies

[Any external dependencies: packages to install, services to configure, environment variables]

## Supporting Documents

- [Research](research.md) — if research was performed
- [Data Model](data-model.md) — if data entities are involved
- [Contracts](contracts.md) — if API changes are involved
```

## PHASE 2.5: Plan-Spec Cross-Reference Check

Before presenting the plan to the user, verify completeness:

1. Read every AC from the spec's Acceptance Criteria section
2. For each AC, verify the plan addresses it:
   - Check the plan's "Layer Map" and "File Impact" for files/components related to this AC
   - Check "Key Design Decisions" for approach decisions relevant to this AC
3. If any AC has no clear implementation path in the plan:
   - Revise the plan to add the missing coverage
   - If you cannot determine the implementation path, add it to the plan's Risk Assessment as: "AC-[N] has no clear implementation path — requires clarification during breakdown"
4. Check the reverse: does the plan's File Impact list files NOT in the spec's Affected Areas? If yes, note them as additions discovered during planning (add to the plan's File Impact table with a note).

## PHASE 3: User Approval

**HARD GATE**: The plan MUST be approved before `/breakdown` can generate tasks.

Present a summary:

"I've created the technical plan at `specs/[feature-name]/plan.md`.

**Approach**: [1-2 sentences]
**Files affected**: [count] ([N] new, [M] modified)
**Key decisions**: [list the most important ones]
**Risks**: [high-risk items if any]
**Supporting docs**: [list what was generated]

Please review and approve. Once approved, run `/breakdown` to generate tasks."

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **Plans describe HOW, not WHAT** — the spec already defines WHAT. Don't repeat requirements, translate them into technical decisions
2. **Constitution compliance is mandatory** — verify before presenting to user. If the plan would violate a rule, redesign or flag it
3. **Reference existing code** — for existing codebases, always reference actual file paths and existing patterns. Don't propose new patterns when existing ones work
4. **Greenfield: follow the scaffolding guide** — the constitution's Section 7 defines where things go. Follow it
5. **Minimal supporting docs** — only create research.md, data-model.md, contracts.md if they're actually needed. Don't create empty files
6. **Memory check** — consult MEMORY.md for lessons about similar technical decisions
7. **Keep it scannable** — tables over paragraphs, decisions over discussions
8. **Docs context comes from the spec** — the spec already incorporates `docs/` knowledge. Do not re-read docs; use the spec's "Current State" and "Affected Areas" sections. If the spec notes stale or missing docs, carry that forward as a plan risk
