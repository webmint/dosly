# /refactor — Focused Code Refactoring Workflow

Lightweight workflow for restructuring code without changing behavior. Uses the project's agents, enforces all constitution rules, and requires approval before applying changes.

## Usage
```
/refactor path/to/file.ts
/refactor path/to/file.ts "extract validation logic into utility"
/refactor path/to/file.ts:42-87
/refactor path/to/file.ts:42-87 "simplify conditional chain"
/refactor
```

## Arguments
- `$ARGUMENTS` — File path (required), optional line range (`:start-end`), and optional goal in quotes. Supports both manual input and IDE-injected context (JetBrains plugin passes active file/selection). If empty, ask the user to specify a file.

## When to Use /refactor vs /specify

Use `/refactor` when:
- The change is behavior-preserving (restructuring, renaming, extracting, simplifying)
- The scope is small and localized (1-5 files affected)
- No new features or behavior changes are needed

Use `/specify` instead when:
- The refactoring requires behavior changes or new features
- Multiple components need coordinated architectural changes
- More than 5 files are affected
- The restructuring requires design decisions or trade-offs

If during analysis (Phase 2) the refactoring turns out to be larger than expected, STOP and recommend the user run `/specify` instead. Do not attempt large refactors through `/refactor`.

## Source Repo Auto-Commit (Wrapper Mode)

Skip this section entirely when `SOURCE_ROOT` is `.` (standalone mode).

**Checkpoint**: At the start of execution, create an empty checkpoint in the source repo:
`git -C $SOURCE_ROOT commit -m "[WIP] checkpoint" --allow-empty` → store hash as `$SOURCE_CHECKPOINT`

**WIP commit**: After code passes verification (Phase 5), commit all source changes:
`git -C $SOURCE_ROOT add -A && git -C $SOURCE_ROOT diff --cached --quiet || git -C $SOURCE_ROOT commit -m "[WIP] source changes"`

**Squash** (at Phase 8.1.1): Propose a commit message and ask user to confirm before committing:
1. Extract ticket ID from source branch name — first match of `[A-Z]{2,}-[0-9]+`
2. Generate description from refactoring goal (Phase 2.4)
3. Present to user: `Proposed source commit: [AAA-123] - Description. Confirm or edit:`
4. On confirmation: `git -C $SOURCE_ROOT reset --soft $SOURCE_CHECKPOINT && git -C $SOURCE_ROOT commit -m "<confirmed message>"`
5. If WIP commits were already pushed to remote, skip squash and warn user

No `Co-Authored-By`. No AI traces. No conventional commit prefixes.

**Recovery**: Phase 0 checks source repo state via wip.md's `## Source Repo Checkpoint` section. Rollback resets source: `git -C $SOURCE_ROOT reset --hard $SOURCE_CHECKPOINT`.

## PHASE 0: Recovery Check

Before anything else, check if a previous refactoring was interrupted.

Read `.claude/wip.md`. If it does NOT exist, skip to PHASE 1.

If it exists, read `.claude/commands/_recovery.md` and follow its instructions with `CALLING_COMMAND = refactor`.

## PHASE 1: Load Context

### 1.1: Read Project Rules

1. Read `constitution.md`
2. Read `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` — note the Source Root (if not `.`, this is a wrapper project)
   - **Source repo tracking** (wrapper mode only, `SOURCE_ROOT != "."`): Record the source repo's current HEAD as `$SOURCE_CHECKPOINT` (`git -C $SOURCE_ROOT rev-parse HEAD`) and the source branch name (`git -C $SOURCE_ROOT branch --show-current`).

### 1.1.5: AC Verification Readiness Check

Read `AC_VERIFICATION` from `.claude/project-config.json`. If the value is `"off"` or the key does not exist, skip this check entirely.

If `AC_VERIFICATION` is `"auto"` or `"browser-only"`:
1. Attempt to call `mcp__chrome-devtools__list_pages` as a lightweight probe.
2. If it **fails** (MCP not available):
   - Display: "Note: Chrome DevTools MCP is not running. When `/verify` runs, frontend AC items will be verified by code reading instead of browser interaction. To enable browser-based AC verification, start the WebStorm JS debugger before running `/verify`."
   - This is informational only — do not block execution.
3. If it **succeeds**: no message needed.

### 1.2: Parse Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract:

1. **If empty** — ask the user to specify a file path and optionally what they want to refactor
2. **First token** = file path. If it contains `:` followed by a digit pattern (e.g., `src/foo.ts:42-87`), split into file path and line range
3. **Remaining tokens** = optional goal string (strip surrounding quotes if present)
4. **If IDE-injected context** includes selected code, use it to narrow the refactoring scope to that selection

If the file does not exist, stop with an error.

### 1.3: Read Target Code

1. Read the target file in full (needed for context regardless of line range)
2. If a line range is specified, note those lines as the primary refactoring scope
3. If selected code was injected by the IDE, locate it in the file and use it as the scope

### 1.4: Identify Related Files

1. Use Grep to find files that import from or are imported by the target file
2. Read the most closely related files (up to 5) — you need to know what utilities, types, and patterns already exist before proposing extractions
3. Check `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` for known pitfalls in this area

### 1.5: Scope Check

Estimate how many files the refactoring will touch:
- **How many files will need changes?** (imports, shared types, etc.)
- **Does this require architectural decisions?**

If the refactoring would affect more than 5 files or requires architectural changes:
```
This refactoring appears larger than expected:
- Estimated files affected: [N]
- Reason: [why it's complex]

Recommend running `/specify "[refactoring description]"` instead for proper planning.
Proceed with /refactor anyway? (not recommended)
```

Wait for user decision. If they say proceed, continue. If not, stop.

## PHASE 2: Analyze

Perform a structured analysis of the code against refactoring categories. This is the core of `/refactor`.

### 2.1: Detect Code Characteristics

Determine what the code is:
- **File layer**: frontend component, backend service, shared utility, type definitions, etc.
- **Pattern type**: component, composable/hook, store, repository, controller, middleware, utility, etc.
- **Metrics**: function count, longest function line count, nesting depth, import count

### 2.2: Scan for Refactoring Opportunities

Check the code against these categories, ordered by priority. If the user provided a goal, prioritize that category and focus the analysis there:

1. **Long Functions** (>40 lines per constitution rule 3.5) — identify extraction candidates with clear responsibilities
2. **Deep Nesting** (>3 levels) — identify early-return conversions and guard clauses
3. **SOLID Violations** — single responsibility violations (functions/components doing multiple things), tight coupling, concrete dependencies where abstractions should be used
4. **DRY Violations** (3+ occurrences per constitution rule 3.6) — duplicated logic that should be extracted into a shared utility or function
5. **Type Safety Issues** — `any` types without justification, missing null checks, unsafe type assertions
6. **Naming Inconsistencies** — identifiers that don't match codebase conventions found in related files
7. **Dead Code** — unused functions, variables, imports, commented-out blocks
8. **Pattern Violations** — code that doesn't follow the patterns established elsewhere in the codebase (compare with similar files read in Phase 1.4)
9. **Complexity** — complex conditionals that could be simplified, unnecessary abstractions that add indirection without value

For each opportunity found, note: the category, affected lines, what's wrong, what the improvement looks like, and which constitution rule or principle it addresses.

### 2.3: Select Agent

Read `.claude/commands/_agent-assignment.md` and select the agent based on the target file's layer and the code characteristics from 2.1. Cross-reference with `CLAUDE.md` project structure to confirm the selection. If the selected agent doesn't exist in `.claude/agents/`, fall back to `architect`.

### 2.4: Present Refactoring Proposal

**HARD GATE** — Present the proposal to the user. No code changes until approved.

```
## Refactoring Proposal

**File**: [path]
**Scope**: [whole file / lines X-Y]
**Agent**: [selected agent name]
**Goal**: [user's goal if provided, or "General code quality improvement"]

### Opportunities Found

#### 1. [Category]: [Short description]
**Priority**: High / Medium / Low
**Lines**: [start-end]
**Current**: [brief description or short code snippet showing the issue]
**Proposed**: [what the refactored version would look like — description or snippet]
**Rationale**: [which constitution rule or principle this addresses]

#### 2. [Category]: [Short description]
...

### Files That Will Change
- [file path]: [what changes]
- [file path]: [what changes]

### Risk Assessment
- **Behavioral changes**: None (this is a pure refactoring)
- **Test impact**: [will existing tests need updating? why?]
- **Import changes**: [will other files' imports break?]

Approve this proposal to proceed? You can also:
- **Approve all** — apply everything
- **Approve specific items** — e.g., "approve 1 and 3"
- **Modify** — request changes to the proposal
- **Cancel** — exit with no changes
```

Wait for user response. Record which items were approved. If the user cancels, exit cleanly with no changes (no WIP marker has been created yet).

**Bugs noticed during analysis**: If actual bugs are discovered (not structural issues), note them separately as "Bugs noticed (out of scope — use `/fix` for these)" and do NOT include them in the refactoring plan.

## PHASE 3: Pre-Flight Check

Before writing ANY code, verify:

1. **Constitution populated**: If `constitution.md` contains `_Run /constitute to populate_`, stop immediately and inform the user: "⛔ constitution.md has not been populated yet. Run `/constitute` before using `/refactor`."
2. **Constitution compliance**: Does the planned refactoring comply with all NON-NEGOTIABLE rules?
3. **Behavior preservation**: Verify that approved changes are genuinely behavior-preserving. If any change would alter observable behavior, flag it and remove from scope
4. **Memory check**: Does MEMORY.md have any warnings about similar changes or this area of code?
5. **File state check**: Are the target files in a clean state? (`git status`)
6. **Scope constraint**: The refactoring must touch ONLY the files identified in the proposal. If more files need changing, re-assess scope (Phase 1.5)

If ANY pre-flight check fails, stop and inform the user with specifics.

### 3.1: Create WIP Marker and Clean Checkpoint

1. Create a git checkpoint BEFORE any changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "[checkpoint] Pre-refactor: [short description]" --allow-empty
   ```

2. **Source repo checkpoint** (wrapper mode only, `SOURCE_ROOT != "."`):
   - Check for pre-existing uncommitted source changes: `git -C $SOURCE_ROOT status --porcelain`. If uncommitted changes exist, warn the user and let them decide to proceed or stop.
   - Create source checkpoint:
     ```
     git -C $SOURCE_ROOT commit -m "[WIP] checkpoint" --allow-empty
     ```
   - Record this hash as `$SOURCE_CHECKPOINT`.

3. Write `.claude/wip.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Work In Progress

   ## Command
   refactor

   ## Refactoring
   Target: [file path]
   Goal: [description]
   Type: refactoring

   ## Started
   Phase: 4 (Apply Refactoring)

   ## Files Being Modified
   - [list from proposal]

   ## Rollback Point
   Commit: [hash from the checkpoint commit above]

   ## Source Repo Checkpoint
   Commit: [source-checkpoint-hash or N/A for standalone]
   Branch: [source-branch-name or N/A]
   ```

## PHASE 4: Apply Refactoring

### 4.1: Launch Agent

Launch the selected agent (from Phase 2.3) with the approved refactoring plan.

Agent prompt must include:

```
You are executing an approved refactoring plan.

## Target
[File path, line range if applicable]

## Approved Refactoring Actions
[Only the actions the user approved — list each with its number, category, and proposed change]

## Context Files
[List of related files the agent should read for context]

## Rules
1. Make ONLY the approved refactoring changes — nothing more
2. This is a BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING refactoring — no functional changes
3. Follow the project's constitution
4. Known pitfalls for this area: [from MEMORY.md]
5. Every file you change must pass TypeScript compilation
6. Every file you change must pass linting
7. Preserve all existing public API signatures unless the refactoring explicitly changes them
8. Update imports in consuming files if you move or rename exports

## Do NOT
- Change behavior or functionality
- Add features
- Fix bugs you notice (note them in your report, don't fix)
- Refactor code outside the approved scope
- Change test assertions (test file restructuring is OK if imports changed)
```

After the agent completes, commit:
```
git add [files you modified] .claude/wip.md && git commit -m "[WIP] Refactor: [short description] — refactoring applied"
```

Update `.claude/wip.md` — change Phase to `5 (Verify)`.

## PHASE 5: Verify (with Self-Repair)

Run verification on all changed files:

1. **Type checker passes**: Run the Type Check Command from CLAUDE.md (e.g. `tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript, `mypy` for Python, `go vet` for Go)
2. **Linter passes**: Run the Lint Command from CLAUDE.md on all changed files
3. **Project builds** (if Build Command is specified in CLAUDE.md): Run the build command. For wrapper mode projects, run inside the Source Root directory. Skip this check if no Build Command is configured.
4. **Tests pass**: Run existing tests on the affected code area (if test infrastructure exists)
5. **Behavior preservation**: Verify that function signatures, exported APIs, and test assertions are still valid
6. **Wrapper isolation check** (wrapper mode only): Verify no Claude artifacts were created inside the Source Root

**Source repo WIP** (wrapper mode only): After all checks pass, run the **WIP commit** from the Source Repo Auto-Commit section above.

**If ALL checks pass** → proceed to Phase 6.

**If any check fails** → enter the self-repair loop (max 3 attempts):

For each repair attempt:
1. Collect all error output (tsc errors, lint errors, build errors, test failures)
2. Apply a targeted fix for ONLY those errors
3. Commit:
   ```
   git add [files you modified] .claude/wip.md && git commit -m "[WIP] Refactor: [short description] — repair attempt [M]/3"
   ```
4. Re-run ALL verification checks

**If verification passes after any attempt** → proceed to Phase 6.

**If all 3 repair attempts are exhausted** → STOP:
- Report the remaining errors to the user
- Keep the WIP marker and commits for inspection
- Suggest: "Run `/refactor` again after manually addressing these errors, or use recovery options"

## PHASE 6: Code Review

Update `.claude/wip.md` — change Phase to `6 (Code Review)`.

Launch the **code-reviewer** agent on ALL changed files.

Provide the agent with:
1. The list of changed files (`git diff --name-only` against the checkpoint commit)
2. The refactoring description and rationale
3. The constitution
4. Relevant entries from `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`

The agent will check: constitution compliance, architecture & patterns, type safety, security basics, code quality, and memory pitfalls.

**Additional check for refactoring**: Verify the refactored code actually improves on the original (not a lateral move or regression in readability).

**If verdict is APPROVE or warnings only** → proceed to Phase 7. Include warnings in the report.

**If verdict is REQUEST CHANGES or BLOCK** → report findings to the user immediately:

```
⚠️ Code review found issues:

#### Critical (blocks completion)
- [file:line] — [description]

#### Warning (should fix)
- [file:line] — [description]

Options:
1. **Address now** — fix the issues, then re-run review
2. **Continue** — proceed despite warnings (Critical issues CANNOT be skipped)
3. **Stop** — halt execution, keep WIP state for manual handling
```

Wait for user response:
- **Address now**: Launch a repair agent to fix the review issues. After fixes, re-run the code-reviewer once. If still BLOCK after this second review, STOP and report: "Code review issues persist after repair. Address manually and re-run `/refactor`."
- **Continue**: Only allowed if there are no Critical issues (warnings only). Proceed to Phase 7 with warnings noted.
- **Stop**: Keep WIP marker and commits. Report state for manual handling.

## PHASE 7: Test Assessment

Update `.claude/wip.md` — change Phase to `7 (Test Assessment)`.

Launch the **qa-engineer** agent to assess test impact.

Provide the agent with:
1. The changed files and the nature of the refactoring
2. The existing test files related to the changed code (find them via Grep/Glob)
3. The refactoring description

The agent should:
1. **Check if existing tests still pass** — since this is behavior-preserving, they should pass without assertion changes
2. **Check if test imports need updating** — if files were moved or exports renamed, test imports may need adjustment
3. **Assess if the refactoring improves testability** — note if the restructured code is now easier to test
4. **If tests fail**: This indicates the refactoring broke something. Diagnose whether the test failure is due to an import change (fixable) or a behavior change (must rollback that specific change)

**Rules for test decisions:**
- Refactoring should not break tests. If tests fail, something went wrong with the refactoring
- Import/path changes in tests are acceptable fixes
- Test assertion changes are NOT acceptable — that means behavior changed
- Run the test suite on changed areas to confirm

If tests were adjusted (import fixes only), commit:
```
git add [test files you modified] && git commit -m "[WIP] Refactor: [short description] — test import fixes"
```

## PHASE 7.5: Documentation Update (MANDATORY)

Update `.claude/wip.md` — change Phase to `7.5 (Documentation)`.

Always invoke the tech-writer — let it decide whether documentation changes are needed.

### 7.5.1: Load Tech-Writer Agent

Read `.claude/agents/tech-writer.md` and include its **full content** as the opening section of the agent prompt. If the file does not exist, proceed with the inline prompt alone.

### 7.5.2: Launch Tech-Writer

Construct the prompt with two parts:

**Part 1** (if agent file exists): The full content of `.claude/agents/tech-writer.md`.

**Part 2** (always included):

```
A refactoring changed these files. Evaluate whether documentation needs updating.

## Refactoring Context
[Refactoring description and approved actions from Phase 2.4]

## Files Changed
[List of changed files]

## Existing Docs
[Output of Glob on docs/ — so you know what already exists]

## Instructions
1. Read each changed file and determine if any public API signatures, import paths, or documented architecture changed
2. If so: update inline docs (JSDoc/docstrings) and the relevant docs/ file
3. If the refactoring was purely internal with no public-facing changes: report "No doc update needed" with justification

Use the document-when/skip-when criteria from the tech-writer workflow (Part 1). For refactoring specifically: also document import path changes and architecture restructuring (new modules, changed layer boundaries).
```

Launch the tech-writer agent with the combined prompt.

### 7.5.3: Commit

If the tech-writer made changes, commit:
```
git add docs/ [source files with doc changes] && git commit -m "[WIP] Refactor: [short description] — doc update"
```

Report the tech-writer's decision in Phase 8.3's report as: `**Documentation**: [Updated docs/architecture.md / No doc update needed — [justification]]`.

## PHASE 8: Report & Clean Up

Update `.claude/wip.md` — change Phase to `8 (Report & Clean Up)`.

### 8.1: Final Commit

Squash all `[WIP]` and `[checkpoint]` commits for this refactoring into a single clean commit.

First, verify WIP commits haven't been pushed to the remote:
```
git log --oneline origin/$(git branch --show-current)..HEAD 2>/dev/null
```
- If this shows commits (or fails because there's no upstream) → WIP commits are **local only** → safe to squash:
  ```
  git reset --soft [checkpoint-commit-hash]
  git commit -m "refactor([area]): [concise description of what was restructured]"
  ```
- If this shows **no commits** (HEAD matches remote) → WIP commits were already pushed → **skip squashing** and keep commits as-is.

Follow the **Commit Convention** section in CLAUDE.md (format and attribution rules).

### 8.1.1: Source Repo Squash (wrapper mode only)

Skip if `SOURCE_ROOT` is `.` or no `[WIP]` commits in source repo.

Run the **Squash** procedure from the Source Repo Auto-Commit section above. Generate the description from the refactoring goal (Phase 2.4).

### 8.2: Delete WIP Marker

Delete `.claude/wip.md`.

### 8.3: Present Report

```
## Refactoring Complete

**Target**: [file path, line range if applicable]
**Goal**: [user's goal or detected opportunities]

**Changes**:
- [file]: [what changed, 1 line]
- [file]: [what changed, 1 line]

**Refactoring actions applied**:
1. [action]: [result]
2. [action]: [result]

**Verification**:
- Type checker: PASS
- Linter: PASS
- Build: PASS [or SKIP if no build command configured]
- Tests: PASS / [details]
- Code review: [APPROVE / issues addressed]
- Behavior preserved: YES

**Documentation**: [Updated docs/architecture.md / Internal refactoring — no public API changes]

**Commit**: `refactor([area]): [description]`
```

## PHASE 9: Memory Update

If anything noteworthy happened during the refactoring, update `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md`:

- **Refactoring pattern**: If a specific restructuring approach worked well in this area, record it
- **Complex area**: If the code was especially tangled or hard to restructure safely, note it as a caution for future work
- **Gotcha discovered**: If the refactoring revealed a hidden coupling or unexpected dependency, record it

Use the format: `- **[AREA]**: [observation] _(Task N / Feature NNN)_`. Add entries under the matching section in MEMORY.md (Known Pitfalls, What Worked, What Failed, External API Quirks, etc.).

Keep entries concise (1-2 lines each). Only update if there's something genuinely useful for future work — not every refactoring needs a memory entry.

## PHASE 10: Session State Update

If `.claude/session-state.md` exists, update it to reflect the refactoring. FULLY OVERWRITE the file (same sliding-window pattern as `/execute-task`):

1. Read the current session-state.md
2. Increment "Tasks completed this session" by 1
3. Update "Last completed" to reference this refactoring (use the commit message as the title)
4. Update "Files Modified Recently" with the files changed in this refactoring
5. Re-estimate context load based on the new task count

If `.claude/session-state.md` does not exist, skip this phase — session state is only initialized by `/execute-task` or `/specify`.

After writing, verify the file is under 40 lines. If over, trim oldest entries from "Key Decisions" and "Files Modified Recently."

## IMPORTANT RULES

1. **Analyze before refactoring** — never apply changes without a structured analysis and user-approved proposal
2. **Behavior preservation is mandatory** — this is refactoring, not feature development. If the change alters behavior, it belongs in `/fix` or `/specify`
3. **Minimal scope** — refactor the target code, nothing else. No "while I'm here" improvements outside the approved scope
4. **Constitution is law** — the refactored code must comply with all constitution rules. Constitution violations are always critical
5. **Hard gate on proposal** — the user must approve the refactoring plan before any code changes
6. **Partial approval is supported** — the user can approve specific refactoring actions and reject others
7. **Self-repair before escalation** — when verification fails, attempt automatic repair (up to 3 times) before stopping
8. **Scope discipline** — if the refactoring grows beyond 5 files, stop and recommend `/specify`
9. **Crash safety** — always write `wip.md` before making changes and delete it only after the final commit
10. **Verify everything** — even if hooks ran, run explicit verification after the refactoring
11. **Tests should not break** — if tests fail after a pure refactoring, the refactoring introduced a behavior change. Fix or rollback
12. **Memory is selective** — only record genuinely useful patterns and gotchas, not routine refactors
